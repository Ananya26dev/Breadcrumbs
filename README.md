# Breadcrumbs

Write a React.js code snippet using React hooks to implement a breadcrumbs component in a React application.

In a web application, breadcrumbs are a navigation aid that provides users with a visual representation of their location within the site's hierarchy. Breadcrumbs typically appear near the top of a page and display a trail of links, each representing a level in the hierarchy leading to the current page.
